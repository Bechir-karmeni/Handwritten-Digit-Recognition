# Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR)
> Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer
to recognize the human handwritten digits from different
sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify
them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). This has been a
topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning.
Digit recognition has many applications like number plate
recognition, postal mail sorting, bank check processing, etc
. In Handwritten digit recognition, we face many challenges
because of different styles of writing of different peoples as it
is not an Optical character recognition. This research provides
a comprehensive comparison between different machine
learning and deep learning algorithms for the purpose of
handwritten digit recognition. For this, we have used Support
Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron, and Convolutional
Neural Network. The comparison between these algorithms
is carried out on the basis of their accuracy, errors, and
testing-training time corroborated by plots and charts that
have been constructed using matplotlib for visualization.
